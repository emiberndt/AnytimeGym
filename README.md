# UX

Throughout the development of Anytime Gym I ensured that I kept the user in mind and ensuring the website is:

- Useful: useful to the user who wants to interact with the product.
- Useable: when interacting with the product, it is a positive experience.
- Valuable: valuable to the site user and the site owner. 


## The Strategy

### Project goal: Recruit member to the Anytime Gym

The main goal for the website is to get noticed from its targeted users. Its users are people interested in joning a gym that is open 24/7.

#### User goals:
- Users will get a positive and inspiring impression from the landing page.
- Users can easily navigate through out the website to find the information needed.
- User will be encouraged to sign up for a membership throughout the website. 

Users should have the ability to find all the information about the gym, its services and memberships on the website, as well as contact info and inspirational pictures.

They should find the website easy to navigate and allow them to gain knowledge about the gym as a potential member. They should be able to see information about the classes 
in terms of what level of cardio- and strength level. 

The site should be clean and straightforward, and aim to point the user to easily become a member. 

#### User Expectations:
The site should provide the user with all the information needed about the gym and how to join to become a member. The site should also be easy to navigate through, 
and should be responsive on both desktop and mobile.

### User Stories:

For the site owner
- I want to showcase the brand and feel of the gym through minimalistic and clean design.
- I want to showcase the feel of the atmosphere of the gym though inspirational pictures throughout the website.
- I want make it easy for users to find all the necessary information that they might be looking for.
- I want to make it accessible for potential customers to join the gym easily where ever they might be located on the site. (always linking to the sign-up form) 
- I want to provide the gyms social channels, to connect with the gym in other ways.

For the site user
- I want to learn about what the gym’s philosophy is.
- I want to be able to see what the gym looks like.
- I want the website to provide easy access to the different sections of the website. 
- I want it to be easy to find contact information, social media links and a map link to be able to se where the gym is located.
- I want to be able to get the necessary information about what kind of memberships the gym offers, as well as the cost.
- I want to be able to join the gym easily.
- I want to get a full view of what gym classes the gym provides and a detailed information of what the classes entails, and what time they are available. 
- I want to be able to navigate through the site quick and easy.

## The Structure

- The elements should all be consistent, in terms of effects, colors, icons and buttons. 
- Horizontal navbar, with the gym’s logo displayed on the left and link back to the landing page. 
- The navbar for the mobile site version, will have the hamburger icon.
- Links to the gym’s social media channels will be in the footer.

## The Skeleton

The wireframes are created with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

You will see differences to the finished website. As I went on to developed the site 
there were certain aspects I thought I could improve from the original idea, to make it more in sync with my user stories.
