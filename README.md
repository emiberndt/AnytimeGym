# The Strategy

### Project goal: Recruit members to the Anytime Gym

#### User goals:
- Users will get a positive and inspiring impression from the landing page.
- Users can easily navigate throughout the website to find the information needed.
- User will be encouraged to sign up for a membership throughout the website. 

Users should have the ability to find all the information about the gym, its services and memberships on the website, as well as contact info and inspirational pictures.

They should find the website easy to navigate and allow them to gain knowledge about the gym as a potential member. They should be able to see information about the classes 
in terms of what level of cardio- and strength level. 

The site should be clean and straightforward, and aim to point the user to easily become a member. 

#### User Expectations:
The site should provide the user with all the information needed about the gym and how to join to become a member. The site should also be easy to navigate through, 
and should be responsive on both desktop, tablet and mobile.

### User Stories:

# Testing

#### Google Developer Tools 

I used Google Developer tools to help identify any errors, aswell as testing its responsive features. 

No issues were found and the responsiveness works nicely.

#### Responsive Tools

I have tested my site on Safari, and Google Chrome and the site looks like it was intended to do. 

[Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) 

Tested on desktop, notebook, tablet, and mobile.

This is where I created the mockup for the site.

[Responsive Design Checker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/) 

Here I was able to test in a more detailed manner how the site would function on a number of different devices:

- Desktop 24"/23"/22"/20"/19"
- Notebook 15"/13"/10"
- Apple iPad mini/Pro/Retina
- Amazon Kindle Fire/Fire HD
- Samsung Galaxy Tab 10
- Apple Iphone 6/6s/7/6s Plus/7 Plus
- Samsung Galaxy S5/S6/S7
- Sony Xperia Z2/Z3

#### Validator Tools

To help validate my HTML and CSS.

HTML:
[W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

Two errors occur:
- Error: Bad value 100% for attribute width on element video: Expected a digit but saw % instead. From line 339, column 9; to line 339, column 37

    video width="100%" controls

    I did however found that this error is a necessity for the video to be able to be responsive.

- Error: The value of the for attribute of the label element must be the ID of a non-hidden form control.

    From line 439, column 33; to line 439, column 54

    label for="ccnumber"

    This was also an error that I found was necessary. I took the layout of the payment form from [BBBootstrap Team](https://bbbootstrap.com/snippets/simple-payment-credit-card-form-41641728), which works perfectly as it is. When trying to fix the error the form will not line up as it should. The label for is necessary for the form to align and look nice and neat.


CSS: [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

Two errors occur:

- 6	abbr[data-original-title], abbr[title]	Property text-decoration-skip-ink doesn't exist : none

- 6	.accordion	Property overflow-anchor doesn't exist : none

    This is something that does not exist in my CSS file, so I don't understand how this even can be detected here. I therefore decided to use a different CSS validator to see if I would get the same errors.

CSS [Code Beautify](https://codebeautify.org/cssvalidate)

No errors occur when I run the code in this validator.



# Deployment

GitHub Pages:

1. Create a repository on GitHub and a project name/description.

5. Use the git push command to push this 
6. It will now ask for your GitHub credentials (enter this in the terminal). 
7. Go to GitHub and load your repo
8. Click on Settings
